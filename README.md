# Med_Img_Classfications

The majority of the existing X-Ray datasets are either very small in size to be used in training machine learning models or lack proper annotation to be used in localization and segmentation. This creates a limitation while comparing different state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods as each study uses its own set of data that is not made public. It also hinders the development of machine-learning algorithms for classification, localization and segmentation. In this work, we introduce a new dataset of more than 14,000 X-Ray scans which was collected.
